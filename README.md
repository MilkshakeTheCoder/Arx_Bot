# Arx Bot!

![Arx_Bot-logos](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/83626443/138509399-17a00c06-bcf3-446b-922c-6b205f63c00a.jpeg)

## Motivation

Our motivation to make this bot came from a small build-up of frustration at other discord bots. They only did specific things, and you had to add multiple of them to make a good server with good bots. A friend and I both shared this belief. We decided that we should make our own discord bot, to cure other people of this frustration. So, that's what we've done! This is a combination of many attributes of many popular bots. Now, half your server-space doesn't get taken up by bots! You just have to add 1!

## Features

This is an all-around Discord Bot, with many features, such as:
* AI-Chat System¬π
* Currency System¬π
* Error Handler¬≥
* Giveaway System¬≥
* Custom Help Command (Not the ugly orginal bot-rendered one.)‚Å¥
* A Welcoming and Leaving System¬≥
* Moderation Commands¬≥
* A Polling System¬≥
* Eval & Stat Commands¬≤
* A Leveling System¬≥
* Reaction-Roles¬≤
* Admin-Only Commands¬≥
* A Calculator System¬≥
* A Suggestion System with Upvotes and Downvotes¬≥
* A Working Dashboard¬π
* A setchannel command where you can set certain channels in your server!¬≥
* and much more!

[Invite The Bot to Your Server!](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=832409595791409242&permissions=8&redirect_uri=http%3A%2F%2F127.0.0.1%3A5000%2Flogin&scope=applications.commands%20bot)

Inviting it would mean a ton to me, the main developer of this bot, to see it in a public server, so please add it! üòÅ

## Prerequisites

Mainly a bunch of pip installs, for the project to work.

Python 3.6+

A working Text Editor or IDE.

and then merely `pip install -U -r requirements.txt`.

## Usage

Many of you that have come across this page, probably want to use this code for yourself. ‚ö° NEWS FLASH ‚ö°, many people that just take things from a person's github and use it for themselves and they DON'T GIVE CREDIT! If you want to use it properly, then you have to give credit to this github page, and all the contributors. [License...](https://github.com/MilkshakeTheCoder/Arx_Bot/blob/main/LICENSE.md)

Well, anyway, to use it, there will be certain things you will have to replace in your code, as well as required prerequisites (mentioned above), in order for the code to work properly.

First things first: You will need to create a bot from your discord developer portal:

Then, you need an API Key for PRSAW from [PGamerX](https://api-info.pgamerx.com/register.html). (Steps should be self explanatory.)

Now, after these steps, this step can go 3 ways from here.

[The 3 ways... (__VERY__ IMPORTANT)](https://github.com/MilkshakeTheCoder/Arx_Bot/blob/main/.github/SECRETS.md)

After that, there will be some [small things] to replace in the code, to make sure it still works.

* And that should be it for prerequisites and installations.

## Running it

To run the bot, simply go to the directory where the bot is stored, then <code>python3 bot.py</code>, or run the file by other means, such as a run button in the ide/text editor. For the dashboard to also work, you will have to run main.py the same way, `python3 main.py` or by a run button.

## Current Build Status
- @MilkshakeTheCoder - (Dashboard, Cleanup, Less Buggy)
- @Andrewthederp - (Currency System Upgrades, Overall better feel.)

## Main Technologies Used
* Python 3.8+
* Discord
* Discord.py
* Github
* Replit
* UpTimeRobot

## After that...
* You should be free to run the code and have a fully functioning bot! If there are problems with our explanation and/code, please be sure to let us know in the discussion below! Also, be sure to join our server!
